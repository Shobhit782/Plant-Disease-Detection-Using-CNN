# Plant Disease Identification System using CNN

## Project Overview:

This project aims to develop a Plant Disease Identification System using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It utilizes a custom-trained CNN model to identify diseases in plants. It also incorporates FastAPI as the API framework to connect the machine learning model with a MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJs, ReactJS, NodeJs) web application.
